# IoT Application

Visualize your AWS IoT data with the IoT Application.

## Prerequisites

1. Install [Volta](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started).
1. Install [Node.js@18 with Volta](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/#features).
1. Install [Yarn with Volta](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/#features).
1. Install global dependencies:
   ```sh
   yarn add global nest turbo typescript
   ```

## Getting Started with local development

1. Install application dependencies:
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```
1. Start development server:
   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```
1. Log in with local Cognito credentials found at `apps/core/.cognito/db`

## Running the tests locally

Run local test command `yarn test` to test the application. The command is "batteries included" - it has everything needed to run and test the application locally.

## Updating generated types locally

Run `yarn gen:types` in root while `yarn dev` is running.

## Deploying to AWS Cloud

1. Install application dependencies:

   ```sh
   yarn workspace cdk cdk deploy --all
   ```
