# IoT dashboard application user guide

## Introduction

The IoT dashboard application helps businesses and application users keep track of their IoT devices and data. By creating and managing custom dashboards, you can monitor your IoT devices and their data in real-time and connect to your AWS IoT SiteWise data. 

## Prerequisites

If you don't have the IoT dashboard application feature, contact your AWS administrator. For information about how to create a portal, see Getting started in the repository's [README.md](../README.md).

## User Creation

NOTE: To prevent unwanted signups, that option is disabled.

An AWS administrator can create application users by following these steps:

1. Find the application **UserPool** by searching `UserPool` on the CloudFormation stack for the application.
    ![user-pool-resource-on-cfn](./imgs/user-pool-resource-on-cfn.png)
1. Choose the **Physical ID** link. This displays the **UserPool** on the **Amazon Cognito** console.

## SiteWise Monitor Dashboard Migration

## Limitations

* In SiteWise Monitor we support [alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/appguide/monitor-alarms.html), but in this application we do not currently support alarms. So, if you migrate your dashboards from SiteWise Monitor, the alarms will not work.
